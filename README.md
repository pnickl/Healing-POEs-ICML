## HEALING PRODUCT OF GAUSSIAN PROCESS EXPERTS - ICML 2020

In this repository can be found implementation of the aggregations and weighting approaches for Gaussian Process PoEs proposed in our paper [1], along with several previously proposed PoEs.

## Aggregation Methods:

* PoE
* gPoE
* BCM
* rBCM
* Barycenter

Along with other baselines:

* Full GP
* Linear regression

## Weighting Methods
* Differential Entropy
* Softmax-Variance
* Uniform
* No-weights
